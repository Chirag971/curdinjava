Java EE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition) is a set of specifications and APIs for building enterprise-level applications in Java. It provides a standardized and modular architecture for developing robust, secure, and scalable applications, especially in multi-tiered distributed environments.

Key Features of Java EE:
1. Multi-Tier Architecture: Supports separation of concerns by dividing applications into presentation, business logic, and data access layers.
2. Scalability: Built to handle high-traffic, large-scale applications with ease.
3. APIs and Libraries: Provides APIs for web services, servlets, JSPs, EJBs, security, transactions, and more.
4. Platform Independence: Applications developed using Java EE are portable across platforms that support the specification.
5. Integration and Interoperability: Facilitates integration with legacy systems, databases, and modern technologies like RESTful services.
6. Security: Includes standardized security mechanisms, such as authentication, authorization, and secure communication.

 Components of Java EE:
   Web Layer: Handles user interaction through technologies like Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and JSF (JavaServer Faces).
   Business Logic Layer**: Processes application logic using technologies like Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB).
   Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage and retrieval with JPA (Java Persistence API).
   Web Services**: Supports RESTful and SOAP-based web services.
   Dependency Injection**: Simplifies application development by managing object lifecycle and dependencies using CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection).

 Modern Evolution:
Java EE was rebranded as **Jakarta EE** when it was transferred to the Eclipse Foundation from Oracle. Jakarta EE continues to evolve as an open-source platform for enterprise Java development.
